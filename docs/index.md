Hi, I'm Sam Ruby:

  * Author of [Agile Web Development with Rails 8](https://pragprog.com/titles/rails8/agile-web-development-with-rails-8/).
  * I develop and run [Showcase software](https://github.com/rubys/showcase?tab=readme-ov-file#showcase) for Dance studios at [smooth.fly.dev](https://smooth.fly.dev/).
  * I am an employee of [Fly.io](https://fly.io/about/).

My showcase software has been used in production for almost 3 years.  Originally hosted on my mac-mini in my attic and used for local events in the mid-atlantic states, it now runs on fly.io and is used by 50 dance studios in 5 countries on 3 continents.

I've written up and given presentations on the current architecture: [Shared Nothing](https://fly.io/docs/blueprints/shared-nothing/), and in the spirit of Rails, am in the process of extracting the code into a toolkit that can be used by others.

fly-atc is the result.

It currently is Rails and Fly.io specific.  I'm seeking:

* Users and Feedback on usage with Rails and Fly.io.
* Collaborators to extend this code base to other frameworks and, yes, even other platforms.
